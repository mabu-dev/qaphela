    "description":
        " Statistics show that most GBV cases are perpetrated by men who are very close to the victims – often their own partners. Furthermore, most case are by repeat offenders, which means women go into relationships with historically abusive men without knowing because they have no access to such empowering information.\n\n Men perpetrate GBV everywhere – at the office, at church or in a family settings, but these cases go unrecorded. This is worse in Africa cultures where such cases are buried forever by the “system”. This allows abusive men to roam the streets free as they target their next victim without any data to reveal the monsters they bury deep inside waiting for the day to explode. This needs to be stopped.\n\n Compounding the problem is an incapacitated justice system where \n\na) police don’t respond promptly to people in need, b) maladministration of GBV cases, \n\nc) inability to prosecute due to lack of evidence. A decentralised community-based approach is required.",
