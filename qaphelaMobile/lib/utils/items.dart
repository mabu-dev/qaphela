        """Statistics show that most GBV acts are carried out by individuals close to the victims such as a family member or a partner. \n
        The victim may not have known of the perpetrators abusive history due to a lack of information about this individual around them. \n
        Individuals who are abusive by nature exist everywhere - church, work, or within the family setting.
        \nHowever, many of these cases usually go unreported and unrecorded, allowing perpetrators to roam about freely looking for their next victim knowing their deeds are consealed and unpunished.
        \nCompounding this problem, is the incapacitated justice system where there is: \n
        1- A delayed response time from police for those in distress.\n
        2- Maladministration of GBV cases\n
        3- Inability to prosecute due to lack of supporting evidence.\n
